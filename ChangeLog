	Remove Snafu.
	After some thought & some research, I decided I want to hand-craft
	my Errors. Thoughts here:

	<https://www.unwoundstack.com/blog/rust-error-handling.html>

	    - Snafu has been removed
	    - `cargo test` passes
	    - `cargo doc` builds cleanly

2021-10-11  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Address issue #5.
	`mppopmd` can now communicate with the mpd server over a local
	(Unix) socket.

2021-03-29  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Repairing GH workflows

	Post rebase checkin.
	This commit updates some packaging details after I rebased
	the 'filters' branch onto 'master'.

2021-03-28  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Documentation commit.
	Broke-up the README; most of its content went into a new
	user manual in Texinfo format. The process of documenting
	filter quoting exposed multiple bugs-- fixed.

2021-03-28  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	First true filter implementation.
	This commit:

	    1. changes the grammar to use an enumeration for the LHS
	       of terms

	    2. adds 'searchadd' to the list of commands supported by
	       mppopmd

	    3. adds 'findadd' & 'searchadd' commands to 'mppopm'

	    4. begins adding unit tests for the evaluator

2021-03-28  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	First commit of filter evaluation logic.
	The filter evaluator is fully functional; method 'findadd' is
	working.

	Adding the `findadd' command.
	This commit implements first support for extending MPD filters
	to include items managed by mpdpopm.

	First commit of the filter parser. Contains just the grammar and some unit tests-- no externally-visible functionality.

	Commented-out the automatic version release now that I've debugged the issue

	Fix release workflow.

	Fix release workflow.

2021-03-10  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Boilerplate update.
	This commit updates copyright statements throughout, as well
	as a few typos.

2021-03-09  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Clear-up some packaging issues.
	This commit:

	    1. addresses issue #3 by providing an Arch package with
	       releases
	    2. addresses issue #4 by providing a systemd unit

2020-12-19  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Commenting out the hard-coded release number in release.yml.

2020-12-17  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Fixing-up release workflow

	Address issue #2.
	This commit contains no new code or features; rather it is a
	significant re-work to the user docs (i.e. README.org) along
	with the provision of pre-built binaries & a Debian binary
	package.

2020-11-24  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Hopefully, my final workflow commit.
	    1. Re-comment the version
	    2. Change the build-release job to only upload source Autotools
	       distros for Ubuntu

	Hard-coding the release version preparatory to forcing a release.

	Updated the README with up-to-date installation instructions.

	Adding a release workflow.

2020-11-22  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Committing my first GitHub Actions workflow

2020-11-18  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Bugfix for issue #1.

2020-10-22  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Preparing for publication to crates.io.

	Generalized commands.
	I removed the "scribbu" feature & associated commands & replaced
	it with a more-general feature in which 'mpdpopm' admins can
	define arbitrary server-side commands.

2020-10-07  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Update the "set-genre" sub-command.
	Change 'mppopm set-genre' to take arbitrary text rather than a
	numeric Winamp genre.

2020-10-06  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Work in progress.
	This commit:

	    1. removes the "send-to-playlist" command
	    2. fixes a bug by which a failure in message processing would
	       cause the daemon to exit

2020-09-19  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	More project hygiene:
	  - running `mppopmd' as a daemon now works
	  - improved the sticker API; it will now coerce caller-supplied
	    types to & from strings
	  - commands::spawn never needed to be async
	  - started building-out the test suite preparatory to more
	    re-factoring

2020-08-13  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	0.1.7 re-factor
	    - add database updates on command completion
	    - add unit tests
	    - general code hygiene

2020-05-25  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Added two new sub-commands & corresponding server-side implementations:
	    1. set-genre
	    2. set-xtag

2020-05-20  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Another massive re-factor.
	Getting closer to "thinking in Rust" (I think). Also implemented new
	commands:

	    1. setpc: set the playcount expplicitly (and run any associated
	       command on the server)
	    2. setlp: set the lastplayed timesetamp explicitly

2020-05-18  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Updates to the latest build.

	Massive re-factor:
	    - split the code into a daemon & a client
	    - moved the basic protocol behind a trait
	    - used that to implement unit tests
	    - cleaned up altogether

2020-04-19  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Stop exiting when the player stops.
	This commit started off as an attempt to fix the handling of player
	state changes; `mpdpopm' was failing whenever the player was
	stopped. While doing so, I wound up re-writing large swaths
	of code. The current status is akin to having your computer
	disassembled on the living room floor; it boots up, but there are
	screws everywhere & disconnected cables on top of it all.

2020-04-12  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Initial implementation of ratings & play counts.
	This is a very preliminary commit of ratings & play count
	implementations. I really just wanted to validate my approach;
	my Rust-fu is so lacking at this point I don't know if I
	can even push this :O

2020-04-08  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Fix typo in README.org.

	Initial commit of `mpdpopm'.
