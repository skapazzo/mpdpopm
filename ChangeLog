	as a few typos.

	Clear-up some packaging issues.
	This commit:

	    1. addresses issue #3 by providing an Arch package with
	       releases
	    2. addresses issue #4 by providing a systemd unit
2020-12-26  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	First commit of the filter parser. Contains just the grammar and some unit tests-- no externally-visible functionality.

2021-02-24  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Adding the `findadd' command.
	This commit implements first support for extending MPD filters
	to include items managed by mpdpopm.

2020-12-19  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Commenting out the hard-coded release number in release.yml.

2020-12-17  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Fixing-up release workflow

	Address issue #2.
	This commit contains no new code or features; rather it is a
	significant re-work to the user docs (i.e. README.org) along
	with the provision of pre-built binaries & a Debian binary
	package.

2020-11-24  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Hopefully, my final workflow commit.
	    1. Re-comment the version
	    2. Change the build-release job to only upload source Autotools
	       distros for Ubuntu

	Hard-coding the release version preparatory to forcing a release.

	Updated the README with up-to-date installation instructions.

	Adding a release workflow.

2020-11-22  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Committing my first GitHub Actions workflow

2020-11-18  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Bugfix for issue #1.

2020-10-22  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Preparing for publication to crates.io.

	Generalized commands.
	I removed the "scribbu" feature & associated commands & replaced
	it with a more-general feature in which 'mpdpopm' admins can
	define arbitrary server-side commands.

2020-10-07  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Update the "set-genre" sub-command.
	Change 'mppopm set-genre' to take arbitrary text rather than a
	numeric Winamp genre.

2020-10-06  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Work in progress.
	This commit:

	    1. removes the "send-to-playlist" command
	    2. fixes a bug by which a failure in message processing would
	       cause the daemon to exit

2020-09-19  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	More project hygiene:
	  - running `mppopmd' as a daemon now works
	  - improved the sticker API; it will now coerce caller-supplied
	    types to & from strings
	  - commands::spawn never needed to be async
	  - started building-out the test suite preparatory to more
	    re-factoring

2020-08-13  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	0.1.7 re-factor
	    - add database updates on command completion
	    - add unit tests
	    - general code hygiene

2020-05-25  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Added two new sub-commands & corresponding server-side implementations:
	    1. set-genre
	    2. set-xtag

2020-05-20  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Another massive re-factor.
	Getting closer to "thinking in Rust" (I think). Also implemented new
	commands:

	    1. setpc: set the playcount expplicitly (and run any associated
	       command on the server)
	    2. setlp: set the lastplayed timesetamp explicitly

2020-05-18  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Updates to the latest build.

	Massive re-factor:
	    - split the code into a daemon & a client
	    - moved the basic protocol behind a trait
	    - used that to implement unit tests
	    - cleaned up altogether

	Stop exiting when the player stops.
	This commit started off as an attempt to fix the handling of player
	state changes; `mpdpopm' was failing whenever the player was
	stopped. While doing so, I wound up re-writing large swaths
	of code. The current status is akin to having your computer
	disassembled on the living room floor; it boots up, but there are
	screws everywhere & disconnected cables on top of it all.

	Initial implementation of ratings & play counts.
	This is a very preliminary commit of ratings & play count
	implementations. I really just wanted to validate my approach;
	my Rust-fu is so lacking at this point I don't know if I
	can even push this :O

2020-04-08  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Fix typo in README.org.

	Initial commit of `mpdpopm'.
