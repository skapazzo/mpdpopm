	Added two new sub-commands & corresponding server-side implementations:
	    1. set-genre
	    2. set-xtag

	Another massive re-factor.
	Getting closer to "thinking in Rust" (I think). Also implemented new
	commands:

	    1. setpc: set the playcount expplicitly (and run any associated
	       command on the server)
	    2. setlp: set the lastplayed timesetamp explicitly

	Updates to the latest build.

	Massive re-factor:
	    - split the code into a daemon & a client
	    - moved the basic protocol behind a trait
	    - used that to implement unit tests
	    - cleaned up altogether

	Stop exiting when the player stops.
	This commit started off as an attempt to fix the handling of player
	state changes; `mpdpopm' was failing whenever the player was
	stopped. While doing so, I wound up re-writing large swaths
	of code. The current status is akin to having your computer
	disassembled on the living room floor; it boots up, but there are
	screws everywhere & disconnected cables on top of it all.

	Initial implementation of ratings & play counts.
	This is a very preliminary commit of ratings & play count
	implementations. I really just wanted to validate my approach;
	my Rust-fu is so lacking at this point I don't know if I
	can even push this :O

	Fix typo in README.org.

	Initial commit of `mpdpopm'.
