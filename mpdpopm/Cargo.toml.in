extended-description = """
mpdpopm provides a companion daemon to mpd <https://www.musicpd.org>/ \
for maintaining play counts, ratings and last-played timestamps, \
along with an associated CLI for talking to the daemon. Similar to \
mpdfav <https://github.com/vincent-petithory/mpdfav>, but written in \
Rust (which I prefer to Go), it will maintain this information in \
your sticker database. Along the lines of mpdcron \
<https://alip.github.io/mpdcron>, it will also allow you to keep that \
information up-to-date in your tags by invoking external \
(user-provided & -configured) commands."""

# If I use "$auto", cargo-deb will choose a fairly recent version of
# libc6 (2.31); I've verified on the debian:slim-latest Docker package
# that it only needs 2.28-10 (and possibly much older). I'm going to
# roll the dice & just specify no version.
