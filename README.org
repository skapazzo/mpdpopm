* Introduction

This will be a companion daemon for [[https://www.musicpd.org/][mpd]] that will maintain play counts & ratings. Similar to [[https://github.com/vincent-petithory/mpdfav][mpdfav]], but written in Rust (which I prefer to Go), it will allow you to maintain that information in your tags, as well as the sticker database, by invoking external commands to keep your tags up-to-date (something along the lines of [[https://alip.github.io/mpdcron][mpdcron]]).

* Status

This is work-in-progress. I have chosen the version number (0.0) in the hopes of indicating that.
